Public SPA website

Branching should go as follows:
  *  initially, changes are made to the 'develop' branch
  *  changes can then be promoted from the 'develop' branch to the 'master' branch (which should be stable; a staging area for production)
  *  'production' is what the live, public-facing website is currently displaying and should only be updated after peer reviewing and testing
